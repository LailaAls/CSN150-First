# CSN150 Notes Repository
### Laila Alsaedi

## Purpose
This repository contains my coursework notes, lab summaries, and project documentation for **CSN150**.

## Equipment Used
- ESP32 Board Manager
- ESP32-CAM (AI Thinker)
- Telegram app
- Laptop with Arduino IDE
- WiFi network

## Tools Used
- Arduino IDE
- ESP32 Board Manager
- UniversalTelegramBot library
- ArduinoJson v6
- Telegram BotFather


## Steps I Followed:

Installed the ESP32 board package in Arduino IDE.
Wired ESP32-CAM to FTDI correctly (including IO0 → GND for upload).
Installed missing libraries (UniversalTelegramBot + ArduinoJson v6).
Created Telegram bot and received API token.
Retrieved my own chat ID.
Added WiFi, token, and chat ID to secrets.h.
Selected AI Thinker ESP32-CAM in Arduino IDE.
Uploaded successfully after fixing chip selection issue.
Opened Telegram and tested /start, /photo, /flash.
Photos transmitted successfully.
Created GitHub repo and documented full build.


## Problems / Solutions

Problem: Missing library
UniversalTelegramBot.h: No such file or directory
Solution: Installed via ZIP from GitHub.

Problem: Wrong board selected
“This chip is ESP32, not ESP32-S3”
Solution: Switched to AI Thinker ESP32-CAM.


## Final Report 
This project helped me understand how to connect hardware and software to make a working IoT device.
I learned how to upload code to the ESP32, fix errors, and set up a Telegram bot. 
I also learned how to make the ESP32 take pictures and send them to my phone through Telegram.
In the end, the project worked the way it should, and the ESP32 responded to all the commands.
This project helped me get better at using Arduino, working with networks, using IoT tools, and writing documentation.
