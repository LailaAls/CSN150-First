*** Face Recognition & Object Detection using AMB82-Mini

This project uses the AMB82-Mini (Ameba Pro 2) board to perform face recognition and object detection using AI.
The system can recognize faces and detect common objects such as cars, chairs, and people in real time.
Live video is streamed using RTSP and viewed through VLC Media Player. 

*** Project Features

Real-time face recognition

Object detection using YOLOv7 Tiny

Live video streaming with RTSP

Face registration using Serial Monitor

*** Hardware Used

AMB82-Mini (Ameba Pro 2)

Built-in camera

USB cable

Computer 

WiFi network

*** Software Used

Arduino IDE

AmebaNN library

VLC Media Player

*** AI Model Used

** YOLOv7 Tiny

YOLO means “You Only Look Once”.
It looks at each image one time and quickly finds objects.

YOLOv7 Tiny can detect:

Cars

Chairs

People

Tables

Bottles

Animals

*** How It Works

The camera captures live video

The video frame is sent to the AI model

YOLOv7 Tiny detects objects and draws boxes

Faces are first shown as Unknown

Faces can be registered with a name

The system recognizes registered faces later

*** Steps to Run the Project

Open Arduino IDE

Go to
File → Examples → AmebaNN → RTSPFaceRecognition

Enter your WiFi SSID and password

Select the AI model using modelSelect()

Task: FACE_RECOGNITION

Model: DEFAULT_YOLOV7TINY

Upload the code to the AMB82-Mini

Press the Reset button

Open Serial Monitor and note the IP address

Open VLC Media Player

Go to Media → Open Network Stream

Enter:
rtsp://IPaddress:554

Registering a Face

*** Aim the camera at one face

In Serial Monitor, type:
REG=Name
Example:
REG=SAM

The face will now be recognized by name

*** Common Problems and Solutions

WiFi not connecting
→ Check WiFi name and password

Video not showing in VLC
→ Make sure the PC and board are on the same WiFi

Face shows “Unknown”

*** Example

Face appears as Unknown

User types REG=SAM

Face is saved

Face is later recognized as SAM

*** Code Reference

Arduino Example: RTSPFaceRecognition

AmebaNN Library

*** What I Learned

How face recognition works on embedded systems

How YOLOv7 Tiny detects objects

How to stream live video using RTSP

How to combine AI, Arduino, and networking

*** Final Report

This project helped me learn how face recognition and object detection
work using AI. I learned how to use YOLOv7 Tiny to recognize
objects like cars, chairs, and people. I also learned how to stream live video
and register faces. This project improved my skills in Arduino, AI, networking, and IoT.
